"""Unified Namespace topic contract (single source of truth).

Plain hierarchical **ISA-95** topics. Each datum is published at the level of the
enterprise that actually owns it, rather than dumping everything under the cell:

    enterprise / site / area / line / cell
    acme       / barcelona / packaging / line1 / conveyor01

* **Cell** (conveyor01)  - raw vibration, features, anomaly score, model info,
  machine state, edge status. These belong to the physical asset.
* **Line** (line1)       - production plan + the line's OEE / production-rate /
  uptime KPIs. A line is planned and measured as a unit.
* **Site** (barcelona)   - maintenance work orders + windows and the site-level
  cost KPI. Maintenance and cost are business functions above a single machine.

Agent reasoning traces live **inside the UNS** at the level each agent operates
on (edge maintenance -> cell, production planning -> line, corporate/CMMS ->
site), so the tree shows where each agent sits in the enterprise. Traces are
published under an ``agents/<name>/trace`` leaf at that level.
